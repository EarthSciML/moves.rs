//! Port of `DummyCalculator.java` — migration plan Phase 3, Task 78
//! (Phase 3 closing checkpoint).
//!
//! `DummyCalculator` is a no-op placeholder that lives in MOVES's production
//! `implementation/ghg/` package but performs no computation. In canonical
//! Java MOVES it subscribed to every emission process at YEAR granularity
//! via `MasterLoopContext.ALL_PROCESSES` (process ID 0) and produced no
//! output — `registrations_count: 0` in `calculator-dag.json`.
//!
//! The Rust port carries empty `subscriptions()` and `registrations()` slices
//! because the Rust framework schedules calculators by real emission process
//! IDs (1–99); there is no ALL_PROCESSES sentinel. The Java subscription was
//! a testing artifact that triggered the calculator once per run regardless of
//! which process was executing; omitting it has no effect on outputs since the
//! calculator produced nothing.
